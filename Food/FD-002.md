Experiment Title: Fried Rice and Egg

What happened?
* Easy to cook
* tasted better
* left me extremely hungry and craved fast food
* Tried fighting craving when I was doing lundry but I caved while waiting for the drying
* Caved and went to McDonalds ( Mediam Big Mac Combo and Water )

Improvment for next test?
* Included salted mince with rice?
    * I feel like it's the salt I am craving
        * this might also be due to dehydration
* swap rice for potatos
    * since they have higher staturation 
* Drink more water
