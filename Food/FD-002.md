# Experiment Title: Fried Rice and Egg

## Observations:

Three servings of egg fried rice were not satiating and left you still feeling hungry.
The taste of the dish was satisfactory but it led you to crave fast food, specifically McDonald's.
Despite your best efforts, you were unable to resist this craving and ended up getting a medium Big Mac Combo meal.
You hypothesize that your craving for McDonald's might be due to a desire for salt and a feeling of dehydration.
You also identified a lack of feeling full, suggesting that you might need to include more fats in your meals.

## Improvements for next time:

Hydrate More: Regularly drinking water is essential for overall health and can also help manage your hunger and thirst cues. This might help with the cravings and feelings of dehydration.

Incorporate More Fats: Fats can contribute to feelings of fullness or satiety. Consider incorporating healthy fats like avocados, olive oil, or nuts into your meals.

Include More Protein: Proteins are known for their satiating effects. By including more protein like lean meats, tofu, or legumes, you might feel fuller for longer.

Consider Your Salt Intake: You hypothesized that you crave fast food due to its salt content. You could experiment with adjusting the salt level in your homemade meals to see if that affects your cravings.

Swap Rice with Potatoes: As you've suggested, swapping rice for potatoes could lead to higher satiety due to the fiber content in potatoes.

Keep Healthy Snacks on Hand: To prevent giving in to fast food cravings, keep some healthy snacks on hand that you can eat quickly when hunger strikes.
