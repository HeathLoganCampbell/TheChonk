# Experiment Title: Fried Rice and Egg

## Observations:

Three servings of egg fried rice were not satiating and left me still feeling hungry.
The taste of the dish was satisfactory but it led me to crave fast food, specifically McDonald's.
Despite my best efforts, I was unable to resist this craving and ended up getting a medium Big Mac Combo meal.
I hypothesize that my craving for McDonald's might be due to a desire for salt and a feeling of dehydration.
I also identified a lack of feeling full, suggesting that I might need to include more fats in my meals.

## Improvements for next time:

**Hydrate More**: Regularly drinking water is essential for overall health and can also help manage my hunger and thirst cues. This might help with the cravings and feelings of dehydration.

**Incorporate More Fats**: Fats can contribute to feelings of fullness or satiety. Consider incorporating healthy fats like avocados, olive oil, or nuts into my meals.

**Include More Protein**: Proteins are known for their satiating effects. By including more protein like lean meats, tofu, or legumes, I might feel fuller for longer.

**Consider my Salt Intake**: hypothesized that I crave fast food due to its salt content. I could experiment with adjusting the salt level in my homemade meals to see if that affects my cravings.

**Swap Rice with Potatoes**: swapping rice for potatoes could lead to higher satiety due to the fiber content in potatoes.

**Keep Healthy Snacks on Hand**: To prevent giving in to fast food cravings, keep some healthy snacks on hand that I can eat quickly when hunger strikes.
