Experiment Title: Fried Rice and Egg

What happened?
* Had 3 servings of egg fried rice but was still hungry
* Easy to cook
* tasted better
* left me extremely hungry and craved fast food
* Tried fighting craving when I was doing lundry but I caved while waiting for the drying
* Caved and went to McDonalds ( Mediam Big Mac Combo and Water )

Thoughts:
* I think I crave McDonalds for the salt, because I am dehydration
* Didn't feel full at all, so need to include more fats

Improvment for next test?
* Drink more water
* Included salted mince with rice
* swap rice for potatos
    * since they have higher staturation 
    * Salt
